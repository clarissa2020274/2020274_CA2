    "This Notebook contains experimental features for CA2 using different databases to store and retreat files from. The goal of this project is to combine language processing techniques and a time series forecasting to predict the average sentiment of tweets for a certein period of time after the apropriate data cleaning and processing tecniques are applied.\n",

    "- First section consists of importing dataset from various databases, and an attemp to evaluate their performance and usability, helping to select the most suitable dataset for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second section will focus on data cleaning and preprocessing the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third section focus on deeper EDA features and Natural Language Processing to undertand the dataset better prior to modeling and extract the sentiment from tweets given.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section four centers on creating the time-series model and selection of apropriate parametrers and hyperparameters to run it.\n",

    "My initial idea, once the dataset given was succesfuly stored in HDFS directory alocated for the CA development (\"CA2/ProjectTweets.csv\"), was to import it straighaway to a noSQL database and perform initial queries inside the HBase enviroment/shell to verify functionality.\n",

    "However my VM had continuous crashes during this process, and the HMaster node managed by Zookeeper kept showing slower times for initializing the commands. After a few seconds the Zookeeper Connection with HDFS and Hase nodes was lost and it was taking me a longer time span to find an alternative. Since the csv file was already in hadoop, I decided to first import from HDFS and the perform some initial cleaning and EDA using Spark framework to process the data to then store the cleneaded data back to HBAse through a connector between Pyspark and the database.\n",
