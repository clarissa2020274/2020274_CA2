    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis, facilitating the cleaning and normalization of text data for effective analysis. \n",
    "Common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: which breaks down text into individual words or tokens,\n",
    "- Stop word removal:  to eliminate irrelevant words, \n",
    "- Stemming and lemmatization for reducing words to their root forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, tokenization of the text column is done with NLTK's word_tokenize function, while stop words can be removed using NLTK's built-in list. Stemming reduces words to base forms by removing suffixes, and lemmatization does the same based on the part of speech. These techniques enhance sentiment analysis accuracy. The bag of words (BoW) model, a natural language processing technique, represents text as numerical features, allowing for analysis with machine learning algorithms.\n",
